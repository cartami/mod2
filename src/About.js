        A product recall usually involves the following steps, which may differ
        according to local laws: Maker or dealer notifies the authorities
        responsible of their intention to recall a product. In some cases the
        government can also request a recall of a product. Consumer hotlines or
        other communication channels are established. The scope of the recall,
        that is, which serial numbers or batch numbers etc. are recalled, is
        often specified. Product recall announcements are released on the
        respective government agency's website (if applicable), as well as in
        paid notices in the metropolitan daily newspapers. In some
        circumstances, heightened publicity will also result in news television
        reports advising of the recall. When a consumer group learns of a recall
        it will also notify the public by various means.
