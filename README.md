### App Summary:

I grabbed the recall data and vehicle images using two CarMD API endpoints. I was able to render the images using card components with the input of a vehicle VIN number.

### Features:

I used tailwind's CSS library for the styling app. Tailwind's custom CSS classes and CSS grid layout helped me better arrange my cards on the browser.
